The psychological breakdown becomes physical when her father, feeling utterly betrayed by her lies about "study groups," confronts her. The argument reaches a dramatic climax as he smashes her phone on the floor. "You broke my life!" she screams. "Was your life in that phone?!" he retorts bitterly.
