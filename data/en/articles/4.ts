const content = `Digital minimalism is a philosophy of using technology in a way that supports your goals and values, rather than allowing it to control your time and attention. It's not about rejecting technology altogether, but about being more intentional and mindful about which digital tools you allow into your life. The first step towards digital minimalism is a "digital declutter." Start by removing all non-essential apps from your phone, especially those you find yourself using mindlessly or that make you feel bad after using them. The next step is to establish clear rules for using the remaining technology. For example, you might set specific times of the day to check email or social media, rather than constantly checking them. It is also crucial to rediscover analog (non-digital) activities that bring you joy and satisfaction. This could include reading, exercising, spending time in nature, or learning a new skill. The goal is to fill the void left by technology with more meaningful and fulfilling activities. Digital minimalism can lead to improved focus, reduced stress, deeper relationships, and a greater sense of control over your life. It's a journey that requires conscious effort, but the benefits of a less cluttered and more present life are immeasurable.`;
