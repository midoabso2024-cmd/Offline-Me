const content = `Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a feeling of anxiety that arises from the belief that other people are having better, more exciting experiences than you are. While this feeling is not new, it has been greatly amplified in the age of social media. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok provide a constant window into the lives of others—or at least, the curated, idealized versions of their lives. This constant social comparison can lead to feelings of inadequacy, dissatisfaction with your own life, and a persistent anxiety that you're not doing enough or that you're not good enough. FOMO preys on our innate need for belonging and social connection. When we see friends enjoying a party we weren't invited to, or traveling to exotic places, we can feel isolated and lonely. This can drive us to compulsively check our phones, for fear of missing an important update or invitation. To combat FOMO, it's important to remember that what we see on social media is not always the full truth. People often share only their best moments, not their daily struggles. Practicing gratitude and focusing on what we have, rather than what we don't, can be helpful. Setting limits on social media use and taking regular breaks can also reduce its negative impact. Ultimately, it's about building a rich and fulfilling life in the real world, so that what happens in the digital world becomes less important.`;
