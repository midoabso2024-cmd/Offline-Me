I was anxious, I couldn't focus, and I felt stuck in a rut. I decided I needed a radical change. One weekend, instead of staying home and staring at my screen, I decided to go on a hike in the nearby mountains. At first, it was difficult. I felt the constant urge to check my phone, and I felt bored without the constant stimulation. But as time went on, I started to notice the beauty of the world around me: the sound of the birds, the smell of the pine trees, the feeling of the sun on my skin. For the first time in a long time, I felt at peace. These hikes became a weekly ritual. The more time I spent in nature, the less I cared about the digital world. I started sleeping better, and I felt more energized and creative. I realized that true happiness doesn't come from likes and followers, but from real experiences and a connection to the world around us. I swapped scrolling for hiking, and in the process, I not only found a new hobby, but I found myself again.`;
