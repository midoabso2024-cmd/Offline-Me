const content = `Smartphone addiction, also known as "nomophobia" (fear of being without a mobile phone), is a behavioral dependency on a mobile device. This addiction is driven by the brain's reward system. Notifications, likes, and shares release small doses of dopamine, creating a positive reinforcement loop. This makes us come back for more, even when it negatively impacts our real lives, including our relationships, work, and mental health. The design of apps and social media platforms exploits this psychological mechanism, with features like infinite scrolling and instant notifications making it difficult to put the device down. Understanding these mechanisms is the first step toward regaining control. Acknowledging that these tools are designed to be compulsively engaging helps us approach them with greater intentionality. Treatment can involve techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to change thought patterns and behaviors related to phone use, as well as practical strategies like setting specific phone-free times, turning off notifications, and finding alternative hobbies that don't involve screens. The goal is not to eliminate technology entirely, but to build a more balanced and intentional relationship with it, where we use it as a tool that serves us, rather than being a slave to it.`;
