const content = `I was addicted to my smartphone. I checked it every few minutes, and I would panic if I left it at home. It controlled my life. As an experiment, I decided to give up my smartphone for a month and use a "dumb" phone instead—one that could only make calls and send text messages. The first week was a shock. I felt lost without Google Maps, disconnected without social media, and bored without the constant stream of content. I had to plan ahead, carry a paper map, and actually talk to people for directions. But then, something amazing happened. I started to be more present in my own life. I noticed small details on my daily commute that I had never seen before. I had deeper conversations with friends and family, because I wasn't constantly distracted by notifications. I started reading more books, and I enjoyed the quiet moments. By the end of the month, I didn't want to go back. I realized that my smartphone wasn't making me more connected, it was making me more isolated. I learned to be comfortable with myself and my own thoughts, and to find joy in the real world. Now, I use a smartphone in moderation, as a tool rather than a crutch. The "dumb" phone experiment was one of the smartest decisions I've ever made.`;
