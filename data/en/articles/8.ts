const content = `I used to spend all of my free time on social media. I would scroll through Instagram, watch TikTok videos, and read comments on Facebook. I was looking for validation from others, measuring my self-worth by the number of likes and followers. But I felt empty. I wasn't creating anything, I was just consuming. One day, I found an old box in the attic with my childhood stamp collection. I remembered the joy I felt when I would search for a rare stamp, and learn about different countries through these miniature images. I decided to get back into the hobby. At first, it felt strange. It was slow and deliberate, unlike the instant gratification of social media. But I soon found myself absorbed in the process. I started visiting stamp shops, joining online forums, and trading with other collectors. It was a way to connect with people over a shared interest, rather than competing for attention. Rediscovering this old hobby gave me a sense of purpose and accomplishment that I wasn't finding online. I learned that true happiness comes from creating something, learning something, and connecting with others on a deeper level. I traded likes for letters, and in the process, I found a part of myself that I had forgotten.`;
