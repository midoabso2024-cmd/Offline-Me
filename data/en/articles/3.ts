const content = `Blue light is a type of high-energy visible light that is emitted by the sun, as well as by artificial sources like smartphone screens, tablets, and computers. While exposure to blue light during the day is beneficial and can boost attention and mood, excessive exposure at night can have serious detrimental effects on our health. The main problem lies in its effect on our circadian rhythm, or the body's natural clock. Blue light suppresses the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles. When we are exposed to blue light in the evening, it signals to our brain that it is still daytime, making it harder for us to fall asleep and reducing the quality of our sleep. Over time, this disruption can lead to chronic health problems, including insomnia, daytime fatigue, poor concentration, and even an increased risk of diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. To mitigate these risks, experts recommend avoiding screens for at least two to three hours before bed. It is also helpful to use "night mode" or "blue light filters" on devices, which reduce the amount of blue light emitted. Additionally, creating a dark, quiet sleep environment can help promote natural melatonin production and improve overall sleep quality.`;
